#Starboy Coffee
<p> A POS style app for ordering drinks.</p>

<h1>How It's Made:</h1>
<p>Utilized: </p> 
    <ul> 
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Node</li>
        <li>Express</li>
        <li>EJS</li>
        <li>CSS(flexbox)</li>
        <li>Bootstrap 5</li>
        <li>MongoDB</li>
        <li>Mongoose</li>
        <li>Passport</li>
    </ul>

<p>Users are able to input costumer name and their chosen order. Then a barista can either sign up or sign in and view all orders and complete them. The program will store which barista completed which order and shout the order out loud for the costumer. <p/>


<h1>Lessons Learned:</h1>
<p>Through building this app, I was able to get comfortable with the basics of GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. As well as further familiarizing myself in using EJS and mongoDB. Additionally I had a very fun time, working with boostrap5 and the voice synth browser features..</p>


<h1>Optimizations</h1>
<p>As someone with no background in art, styling could definitely use improvements.</p>
<p>Optimize CSS</p>
<p>Some of the code needs to refactored for better readabiility. Some deprecated code (bodyparser) needs to be updated </p>
<p>Upcoming features: </p>
    <ul> 
        <li>Accessibilty features like, high contrast and zoom in options</li>
        <li>Adding more costumizability for the voices used based on the gender of the barista</li>
        <li> More costumizability for costumers</li>
    </ul>
